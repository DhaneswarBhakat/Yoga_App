Built with Flutter, this app offers a seamless and intuitive experience, thanks to its responsive design and smooth navigation. But what sets it apart is its thoughtful integration of state-of-the-art features to support you every step of the way.

🔍 Provider State Management: Say goodbye to tangled code and hello to clarity! With the Provider state management package, I've ensured that the app maintains smooth transitions between multiple screens, allowing for a seamless user experience.

📊 Local Database with SQFlite: Dive deep into your yoga journey with our extensive database of different yoga types. Powered by SQFlite, the app stores a wealth of yoga poses and routines locally, ensuring quick access to your favorite practices anytime, anywhere.

📝 Shared Preferences for Dynamic Tracking: Track your progress in real-time with dynamic parameters that adapt as your yoga session unfolds. From strike count to calories burned and minutes spent, every aspect of your practice is meticulously recorded using Shared Preferences, providing invaluable insights to fuel your growth.

⏸️ Pause, Reset, and Restart: Life happens, and sometimes you need to hit pause. With the app's intuitive toggle section, you can seamlessly pause, reset, or restart your yoga session at any time, empowering you to take control of your practice with ease.

⏳ Break Time Screen: Every journey needs moments of rest and reflection. Between each yoga session, indulge in a moment of tranquility with the app's dedicated break time screen, allowing you to recharge and rejuvenate before diving back into your practice.
